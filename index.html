            <p>We can almost guarantee you won’t have leftovers—this is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe around! If
                you do end up with any extra chocolate chip cookies, they can easily be stored for later enjoyment. To
                keep
                your leftover cookies chewy and soft, store them at room temperature in resealable food-storage plastic
                bags
                or stacked in tightly covered containers.
            </p>
            <p>If you want to freeze your homemade chocolate chip cookies instead, wait until they’ve cooled completely.
                Stack them in between layers of wax paper in a covered freezer container or plastic freezer bag and
                freeze your cookies for up to 2 months. To thaw, keep them covered at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours.
                Go ahead and chow down!
